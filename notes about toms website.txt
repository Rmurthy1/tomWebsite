notes about toms website:

- remove copywrite
- ask him what kind of headings he wants for the thumbnails that will lead into his full article
- ask him if how he wants the pictures formatted on the site, should they sit at the top/bottom/middle/text around?
	- hh article has two images now
- change bootstrab core js on the bottom of every website so that it loads the proper js libs
- koRnberg lab(no s)
